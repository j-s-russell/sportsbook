# Sportsbook

Website Link: https://jsr-sportsbook.herokuapp.com/

This project is designed to provide the basic aspects of a typical sportsbook without any actual money at stake. Currently, the site includes the four major American sports leagues: the NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL. Bets can be placed on the money line or spread, and will be updated the following morning.
This web application was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Django framework in Python. All game information and odds were pulled from The Odds API, found at https://the-odds-api.com/.
